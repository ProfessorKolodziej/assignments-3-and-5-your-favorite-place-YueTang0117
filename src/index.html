heat. The people here are as
passionate as fire too!</p>

    <li>Satori Mountain
      <p>Come here to see the most beautiful cherry blossom tree in the entire continent. Located in the southwest of Hyrule, Satori Mountain is a natural reserve for flora and fauna.
It is said that by offering a piece of
fruit to the altar on the mountain top,
you will be blessed by the mountain
god. </p>

the entire continent or even bungee
jump. Hopefully you're not afraid of
heights!</p>
